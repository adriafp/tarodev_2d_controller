#### User guide:<br>
1. Create a layer for your ground and assign it to your ground and other obstacles. Set the 'Ground Layer' on the controller and animator scripts.<br>
2. Set your controllers bounding box to match your character. <br>

## About the 'Extended' controller (Patreon)
Converted to use standard unity physics, making it much easier to use and incorporate into your game.<br>
It's even smoother than the current version.<br>
Fixed a bunch of bugs.<br>
Added dash and double jump (more planned).<br>
And of course better support.<br>
